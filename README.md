# Problem Statement
COVID-19 has affected millions of people worldwide, leading to significant public health and economic challenges. In response, governments, healthcare providers, and researchers have leveraged data to track and analyze the spread of the virus. However, the abundance of data available can be overwhelming and difficult to interpret, making it challenging to make informed decisions. Therefore, this project aims to develop an interactive Excel dashboard that consolidates COVID-19 data from reliable sources and presents it in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand format. The dashboard will help users explore and visualize key metrics such as infection rates, mortality rates, and vaccination rates, enabling them to track the pandemic's progression and identify trends in real-time. The ultimate goal is to provide decision-makers with actionable insights to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 and make informed decisions about public health and economic policies.

# Data sourcing
The data for this project will be sourced from reliable and authoritative sources such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and other official health organizations. The data will be extracted and processed using Python scripts, which will ensure accuracy and consistency. The dashboard will be updated regularly to reflect the latest available data. We recognize the importance of using accurate and reliable data, especially when it comes to public health. Therefore, we will take the necessary steps to ensure the quality and integrity of the data used in this project.

# Data Cleaning
The raw data will be processed and cleaned using Excel to ensure that it is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis. The data cleaning process will include removing duplicates, handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and transforming the data into a format that is suitable for visualization. Additionally, we will use statistical methods to identify and remove any outliers or anomalies in the data. We recognize the importance of clean data for accurate analysis and decision-making, and we will take the necessary steps to ensure that our data is of high quality.

# Findings and Recommendations
Findings and Recommendations:
Through the development of our interactive Excel dashboard, we have been able to explore and visualize key metrics related to the spread of COVID-19, including infection rates, mortality rates, and vaccination rates. Our analysis has revealed trends in the data that can help inform decision-making by policymakers, healthcare providers, and the public.

Specifically, we have found that certain demographics, such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions, are at a higher risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19. Additionally, vaccination rates have had a significant impact on reducing infection rates and hospitalizations.

Based on our findings, we recommend that policymakers prioritize the distribution of vaccines to high-risk populations and encourage continued efforts to promote vaccination to the general public. We also recommend that individuals continue to follow public health guidelines such as wearing masks and practicing social distancing, especially in high-risk situations. Our Excel dashboard can serve as a useful tool for tracking the progression of the pandemic and identifying areas where intervention is needed.
